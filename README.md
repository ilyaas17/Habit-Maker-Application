# Habit Maker Web Application

## Overview

Welcome to Habit Maker, a user-friendly web application built with React designed to help you manage your daily tasks and habits more efficiently. This README will provide you with an overview of the project's structure and offer insights into how the key components function.

## How to Use

## Project Structure

### `App.js`

The `App.js` file serves as the main component responsible for rendering the entire application. It includes components such as `HabitInput` for adding new habits and `ShowHabits` for displaying existing ones.

### `HabitInput.js`

The `HabitInput.js` component is responsible for capturing user input to add a new habit. It features form fields for 'What,' 'Where,' 'Why,' and 'Date,' ensuring comprehensive habit recording.

### `ShowHabits.js`

In `ShowHabits.js`, users can view a list of their habits. Each habit is accompanied by a delete button for easy management.

### `TaskContainer.js`

`TaskContainer.js` acts as a simple wrapper component designed for styling purposes, providing a structured layout for the habit-related components.

## Improvements

1. **User Feedback**: Consider implementing visual feedback for successful habit addition and deletion to enhance user experience.

2. **Data Persistence**: Integrate a backend server or database to store habit data permanently, enabling users to access their habits across sessions.

3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

4. **Documentation**: Provide additional documentation, including component usage examples and potential customization options, to facilitate easier understanding and customization for developers.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors or invalid user inputs.

By incorporating these improvements, the Habit Maker web application can become even more robust and user-friendly, catering to the needs of a broader audience.
